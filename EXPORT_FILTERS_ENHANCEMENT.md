# Export Page Filter Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the Export Page with comprehensive filtering options and an improved date picker UI to address the two main issues:
1. ✅ Not enough filtering options
2. ✅ Date filter enhanced with mini calendar picker

## What Was Changed

### File Modified
- `src/components/export/ExportPage.tsx`

### New Features Added

#### 1. Enhanced Date Range Filter with Calendar Picker
- **Before**: Plain text input fields (mm/dd/yyyy format)
- **After**: Interactive calendar picker with visual date selection
  - Uses the existing `DateRangePicker` component
  - Shows dual-month calendar view for easy range selection
  - Displays formatted date range with clear visual feedback
  - Better UX with calendar icon and hover states

#### 2. Application Status Filter
- Filter exports by application status
- Multi-select checkboxes for all statuses:
  - Target
  - Hunting
  - Applied
  - Interviewing
  - Offer
  - Accepted
  - Rejected
  - Withdrawn

#### 3. Work Type Filter
- Filter by work arrangement:
  - Remote
  - Hybrid
  - Onsite

#### 4. Employment Type Filter
- Filter by employment type:
  - Full-time
  - Part-time
  - Contract
  - Internship

#### 5. Priority Filter
- Filter by application priority:
  - Low
  - Medium
  - High

### UI Improvements

#### Active Filter Summary
- Shows count of filtered vs total applications
- Visual indicator with blue accent when filters are active
- Example: "Showing 15 of 50 applications (35 filtered out)"

#### Clear All Filters Button
- One-click button to reset all filters
- Only appears when filters are active
- Located in card header for easy access

#### Real-time Stats Update
- Stats cards at the top update based on active filters
- Shows filtered counts for applications and interviews
- Provides immediate visual feedback on filter impact

### Technical Implementation

#### State Management
```typescript
// Date range using react-day-picker DateRange type
const [dateRange, setDateRange] = useState<DateRange | undefined>();

// Multiple filter states
const [selectedStatuses, setSelectedStatuses] = useState<ApplicationStatus[]>([]);
const [selectedWorkTypes, setSelectedWorkTypes] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [selectedEmploymentTypes, setSelectedEmploymentTypes] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [selectedPriorities, setSelectedPriorities] = useState<string[]>([]);
```

#### Filtered Data with useMemo
- Efficient filtering using `useMemo` hook
- Prevents unnecessary re-calculations
- Applies all filters in sequence:
  1. Date range
  2. Status
  3. Work type
  4. Employment type
  5. Priority

#### Filter Logic
```typescript
const filteredApplications = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = [...applications];
  
  // Apply date range filter
  if (dateRange?.from || dateRange?.to) {
    filtered = filterApplicationsByDateRange(filtered, {
      startDate: dateRange.from,
      endDate: dateRange.to,
    });
  }
  
  // Apply other filters (status, work type, etc.)
  // ...
  
  return filtered;
}, [applications, dateRange, selectedStatuses, ...]);
```

### Benefits

#### For Users
1. **More Control**: Fine-grained control over what data to export
2. **Better UX**: Visual calendar picker is more intuitive than text inputs
3. **Time Savings**: Multi-select filters allow complex queries quickly
4. **Clarity**: Active filter summary shows exactly what's being exported
5. **Flexibility**: Can combine multiple filters for precise data selection

#### For Development
1. **Reusable Components**: Uses existing UI components (`DateRangePicker`, `Checkbox`)
2. **Performance**: Optimized with `useMemo` for efficient filtering
3. **Type Safety**: Fully typed with TypeScript
4. **Maintainable**: Clean separation of filter logic and UI
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add more filter options in the future

## Usage Example

### Scenario 1: Export Last Month's Remote Job Applications
1. Open Export page
2. Click on Date Range picker
3. Select date range (e.g., last month)
4. Check "Remote" in Work Type filter
5. Click Export button
6. Result: Only remote job applications from last month are exported

### Scenario 2: Export High Priority Interviewing Applications
1. Select "Interviewing" status checkbox
2. Select "High" priority checkbox
3. View summary: "Showing 8 of 50 applications (42 filtered out)"
4. Export with confidence knowing exactly what's included

### Scenario 3: Export Full-time Offers
1. Check "Offer" status
2. Check "Full-time" employment type
3. Export to compare offers

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

1. **Save Filter Presets**: Allow users to save commonly used filter combinations
2. **Interview Filters**: Add similar filtering for interviews (type, status)
3. **Company Filters**: Add filters for company-specific exports
4. **Document Filters**: Filter documents by type, tags, or usage
5. **Advanced Date Presets**: Quick shortcuts like "Last 7 days", "This month", "Last quarter"
6. **Tag Filter**: Filter applications by custom tags
7. **Salary Range Filter**: Filter by salary range (min/max)
8. **Location Filter**: Filter by job location

## Notes

- All filters are optional - leaving them empty exports all data
- Filters only affect Applications and Interviews exports
- Documents and Companies exports are not filtered (future enhancement)
- The date range filter applies to `appliedDate` for applications and `scheduledAt` for interviews
- Filter state is not persisted - resets on page refresh
