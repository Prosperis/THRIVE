  - UI vendor bundle (Lucide, Framer Motion)
- ✅ Environment-aware configuration (dev vs production)

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Automatic deployment on push to `main`
- ✅ Complete CI/CD pipeline:
  1. Install dependencies with Bun
  2. Type checking (`bun run type-check`)
  3. Linting (`bun run lint`)
  4. Production build (`bun run build`)
  5. Upload artifacts
  6. Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Proper permissions configured
- ✅ Concurrency control to prevent conflicts

#### Package Scripts
- ✅ `bun run deploy` - Manual deployment command
- ✅ `bun run predeploy` - Automatic pre-deploy build
- ✅ `bun run setup:monitoring` - Interactive monitoring setup

# 
# Live in 2-5 minutes! 🎉
```

### Manual Deployment (If Needed)

```bash
bun run deploy
```
