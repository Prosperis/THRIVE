# Phase 4.4: Kanban Board - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a fully functional drag-and-drop Kanban board for visualizing and managing job applications by status.

## Dependencies Installed
- `@dnd-kit/core@6.3.1` - Core drag-and-drop functionality
- `@dnd-kit/sortable@10.0.0` - Sortable list utilities
- `@dnd-kit/utilities@3.2.2` - Helper utilities for transformations

## Components Created

### 1. KanbanBoard (`src/components/features/applications/KanbanBoard.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Main container component that orchestrates the drag-and-drop functionality

**Key Features**:
- DndContext setup with pointer sensors
- Groups applications by status using `APPLICATION_STATUSES`
- Handles drag events (start, end, cancel)
- Updates application status on successful drop
- Shows drag overlay with active card
- Uses `closestCorners` collision detection for better UX

**State Management**:
- Tracks active dragging card for overlay
- Uses Zustand store for application updates
- Memoized application grouping for performance

### 2. KanbanColumn (`src/components/features/applications/KanbanColumn.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Represents a single status column in the Kanban board

**Key Features**:
- Droppable area using `useDroppable` hook
- Visual feedback when hovering (border and background change)
- Column header with status label, description, and count badge
- Color-coded status indicator dot
- Minimum height of 400px for better UX
- Empty state message when no applications

**Props**:
```typescript
{
  status: {
    value: ApplicationStatus;
    label: string;
    description: string;
    color: string;
  };
  applications: Application[];
  count: number;
}
```

### 3. KanbanCard (`src/components/features/applications/KanbanCard.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Individual draggable card representing an application

**Key Features**:
- Draggable using `useSortable` hook
- Displays key application details:
  - Position title and company name
  - Priority badge (low/medium/high)
  - Location and work type (remote/hybrid/onsite)
  - Salary range with currency formatting
  - Applied date
  - Tags (max 3 shown, with overflow indicator)
- Actions dropdown menu (View, Edit, Delete)
- Drag handle with grip icon
- Visual feedback during drag (opacity change)
- Drag overlay support for smooth animations

**Styling**:
- Color-coded priority badges
- Work type emoji indicators (üè† remote, üîÑ hybrid, üè¢ onsite)
- Compact card design (320px width)
- Responsive text truncation

## Integration

### Updated Files
1. **`src/routes/applications.tsx`**
   - Imported `KanbanBoard` component
   - Replaced placeholder with actual Kanban board
   - View toggle now switches between table and Kanban seamlessly

## Status Columns
The Kanban board displays 8 columns based on `APPLICATION_STATUSES`:

1. **Target** (Gray) - Companies/positions identified as potential opportunities
2. **Hunting** (Blue) - Actively researching and preparing application materials
3. **Applied** (Yellow) - Application submitted, awaiting response
4. **Interviewing** (Purple) - In active interview process
5. **Offer** (Green) - Received job offer, evaluating terms
6. **Accepted** (Emerald) - Offer accepted, employment confirmed
7. **Rejected** (Red) - Application rejected
8. **Withdrawn** (Orange) - Application withdrawn

## User Experience

### Drag-and-Drop Workflow
1. User clicks and holds on a card's drag handle (grip icon)
2. Card becomes semi-transparent (50% opacity)
3. Drag overlay shows rotated card for visual feedback
4. Target column highlights with primary color when hovering
5. On drop, application status updates in Zustand store
6. Store persists to IndexedDB automatically
7. Kanban board re-renders with new grouping

### Visual Feedback
- **Grab cursor** on cards indicates draggable
- **Active cursor** changes to grabbing during drag
- **Column highlighting** shows valid drop targets
- **Drag overlay** provides smooth, natural drag experience
- **Opacity change** on source card shows it's being moved

## Performance Optimizations
- Memoized application grouping to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Efficient drag sensor with 8px activation distance (prevents accidental drags)
- Minimal re-renders using proper React hooks
- Optimistic UI updates (immediate visual feedback)

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support (built into dnd-kit)
- Screen reader compatible drag-and-drop
- Clear visual indicators for drag states
- Semantic HTML structure

## Technical Highlights
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support throughout
- **Responsive**: Horizontal scroll for many columns
- **Performant**: Efficient rendering with proper React patterns
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns (Board ‚Üí Column ‚Üí Card)
- **Extensible**: Easy to add features like card reordering within columns

## Build Stats
- Bundle size: 662.67 kB (gzipped: 206.34 kB)
- CSS: 42.13 kB (gzipped: 8.13 kB)
- Build time: ~5 seconds
- All type checks passing ‚úì
- All lint checks passing ‚úì

## Next Steps (Phase 4.5 & 4.6)
- Add advanced filters (status, priority, work type, date ranges)
- Implement bulk operations (select, delete, status update, export)
- Consider adding card reordering within columns
- Add animations for card movements
- Implement undo/redo for drag operations
