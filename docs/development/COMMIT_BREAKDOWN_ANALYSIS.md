## 🔧 Git Commands Cheat Sheet

### Stage Entire New Files
```bash
# Stage a new file
git add path/to/newfile.tsx
```

### Stage Specific Hunks (Interactive)
```bash
# Start interactive staging
git add -p path/to/file.tsx

# Commands during interactive staging:
# y - stage this hunk
# n - do not stage this hunk
# q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any remaining
# a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
# d - do not stage this hunk or any later hunks in the file
# s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks
# e - manually edit the current hunk
```

### Stage Specific Lines (Manual Edit)
```bash
# Edit hunks manually (press 'e' during interactive staging)
# Remove lines you don't want to stage (delete the line entirely)
# Lines starting with '+' are additions
# Lines starting with '-' are deletions
# Lines starting with ' ' (space) are context
```

### Check What's Staged
```bash
# See staged changes
git diff --cached

# See unstaged changes
git diff

# See status
git status
```

### Unstage if Needed
```bash
# Unstage a file
git reset HEAD path/to/file.tsx

# Unstage specific hunks
git reset -p path/to/file.tsx
```

## 📋 Validation Checklist

After each commit:
- [ ] Run `bun run build` to ensure no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run `bun run lint` to check for linting issues
- [ ] Review `git diff --cached` to verify only intended changes are staged
- [ ] Write clear, descriptive commit message following conventional commits
- [ ] Test the feature locally if possible

---

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ Atomic Commits
- Each commit is self-contained and focused
- Easy to review individual changes
- Can be cherry-picked if needed
- Clear history of feature development

### ✅ Logical Grouping
- Related changes are grouped together
- Dependencies are met in order
- Features can be tested independently

### ✅ Better Code Review
- Reviewers can understand changes incrementally
- Smaller diffs are easier to review
- Context is clear for each change

### ✅ Easier Rollback
- Can revert individual features if needed
- Less risk of breaking unrelated features
- Cleaner git history

### ✅ Professional Git History
- Clear progression of development
- Follows conventional commits standard
- Easy to generate changelogs

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Option 1: Stage All at Once (Not Recommended)
```bash
# WARNING: This stages everything together (not atomic)
git add .
git commit -m "feat(documents): massive update with all features"
```

### Option 2: Follow Commit Breakdown (Recommended)
```bash
# Start with Commit 1
git add src/components/ui/accordion.tsx
git commit -m "feat(ui): add accordion component for collapsible sections"

# Continue with Commit 2
git add -p src/types/index.ts
git add -p src/lib/utils.ts
git commit -m "feat(types): enhance document types with version tracking and document links"

# ... and so on following the breakdown above
```

---

## 📊 Estimated Time to Complete

- **Manual Staging**: 2-3 hours (careful selection of hunks)
- **Commit Messages**: 30 minutes (following template)
- **Validation**: 1 hour (testing each commit)
- **Total**: ~4 hours for professional, atomic commits

**Note**: This is time well spent for a clean, maintainable git history!

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use a Git GUI**: Tools like GitKraken, SourceTree, or VS Code's Git panel make interactive staging easier
2. **Commit Often**: Don't try to do all commits in one session
3. **Test Between Commits**: Build and test after staging to catch issues early
4. **Review Diffs**: Always review `git diff --cached` before committing
5. **Write Good Messages**: Follow the template exactly for consistency
