bun run deploy
git checkout main
```

---

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

- âœ… Site loads at production URL
- âœ… All features working correctly
- âœ… No console errors
- âœ… Performance metrics good (Lighthouse > 90)
- âœ… Accessible (WCAG AA compliant)
- âœ… Responsive on all devices
- âœ… Works in all major browsers
- âœ… Data persists correctly
- âœ… Navigation smooth and functional
- âœ… Monitoring active (if configured)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
**Check:**
- TypeScript errors: `bun run type-check`
- Linting errors: `bun run lint`
- Missing dependencies: `bun install`
- GitHub Actions logs for details

### Assets 404
**Fix:**
- Verify `base: '/thrive/'` in `vite.config.ts`
- Check asset paths are relative
- Rebuild: `bun run build`

### Data Not Persisting
**Check:**
- Browser supports IndexedDB
- No errors in console
- Privacy mode disabled (blocks IndexedDB)

### Slow Performance
**Optimize:**
- Check bundle size: `bunx vite-bundle-visualizer`
- Optimize images
- Review code splitting
- Enable lazy loading
