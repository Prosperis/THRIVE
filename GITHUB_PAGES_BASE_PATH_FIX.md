# GitHub Pages Base Path Fix

## Issue
The application was showing a 404 error when accessing https://adriandarian.github.io/thrive/ because the built assets were using incorrect paths.

## Root Cause
The Vite config was conditionally setting the base path:
```typescript
base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/thrive/' : '/',
```

However, the `NODE_ENV` environment variable wasn't being set correctly during local builds, causing assets to be generated with `/` instead of `/thrive/` paths.

## Solution
Changed the Vite config to always use the `/thrive/` base path:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/thrive/',
  // ... rest of config
})
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
```html
<!-- Incorrect paths -->
<link rel="icon" href="/vite.svg" />
<script src="/assets/index-xxx.js"></script>
```
Result: 404 errors on GitHub Pages

### After Fix
```html
<!-- Correct paths -->
<link rel="icon" href="/thrive/vite.svg" />
<script src="/thrive/assets/index-xxx.js"></script>
```
Result: ✅ App loads correctly!

## Local Development

For local development, you can access the app at:
- **With base path**: http://localhost:5173/thrive/
- The router handles the base path automatically

## Deployment Structure

After deployment, the structure is:
```
https://adriandarian.github.io/thrive/
├── /                    # Application (all assets use /thrive/ prefix)
├── /docs/              # VitePress documentation
└── assets/             # JS/CSS bundles
```

## Testing

### Local Testing with Correct Path
```bash
# Build with production settings
bun run build

# Preview the built site (will use /thrive/ paths)
bun run preview
# Access at: http://localhost:4173/thrive/
```

### Verify Paths
```bash
# Check that all assets have /thrive/ prefix
type dist\index.html | findstr "href"
type dist\index.html | findstr "src"
```

## Files Changed
- `vite.config.ts` - Simplified base path configuration

## Status
✅ **Fixed and deployed**

The next GitHub Actions run will deploy the corrected build with proper paths.
